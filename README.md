# Welcome to our lab 👋

You can open the Jupyter Notebooks in Colab (on this [site](https://kirenz.github.io/lab-langchain-functions/slide.html)) or in GitHub Codespaces (see instructions below).

## Create Codespace


[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/kirenz/lab-langchain-functions?quickstart=1)

1. Simply choose the *default* settings and create the Codespace.

2. After the container is created, you will see the following text in the terminal (wait until the installation process is done):

```bash
	"postCreateCommand": "pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt"
```


## Configure your Codespace

After your Codespace is ready, you may want to: 

1. Click on *activate* if you see the pop-up *Thanks for installing vscode-icons* (in the lower right right corner of your screen)

2. If needed, provide **API-keys** (e.g. OpenAi or Hugging Face) in the file `.env-template`. Then save your changes and rename the file to `.env`

3. Open *Extensions*, select *Atom One Dark Theme* and click on *Set Color Theme* to change the user interface

4. Open *Explorer* and open the folder 📂 *code*. Now you can select a Jupyter Notebook

5. Click on the *Kernel* picker, choose *Python environments* and select the latest Python version 

6. Note that the changes you make during the container session are not saved (this is only done with commits to the GitHub repo)

7. When you are done, you can click on the connection icon `><` in the lower left corner of the VS Code user interface and select *Stop Current Codespace* from the menu

8. Visit the [GitHub Codespaces overview](https://github.com/codespaces) and make sure that you don't have active Codespaces
