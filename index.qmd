:::

Upon completing this course, you will acquire the ability to:

- Produce structured outputs, encompassing function calls, through the utilization of LLMs
- Employ LCEL for streamlining the customization process of chains and agents in application development
- Implement function calling techniques for tasks such as tagging and data extraction
- Comprehend tool selection and routing methodologies using LangChain tools and LLM function calling
